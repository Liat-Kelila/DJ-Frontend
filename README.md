# DJ-Frontend

Frontend application was build using Javascript and HTML within a React framework - built with one main app component and two external components called Input and Update. CSS and a minimal amount of boostrap were used for styling. 

App allows me as the user to input entries which list details and notes about previous gigs, so it is essentially a music blog. Previous gig entries are rendered on the main page, and there is a button which allows for new entries. As each entry is submitted, it then appears on the main page with the rest of the entries. Each entry also allows for user to update and delete the entry. 

If I had more time, I would have liked to have made this into my entire DJ website, in which I could input and edit photos, videos, songs, and the blog would only be one component of the website. I would also like to incorporate more boostrap and general css styling.
